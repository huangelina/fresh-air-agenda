This week I worked on:

* Getting the create event endpoint working
* Getting the CRUD endpoints for users working\
* Debugging with the team

On Monday the team finished our first endpoints
together with post requests for events and users
and got authentication started. Once we had all
helped get an endpoint working and got it to require
authentication we dispersed the remaining endpoints
and went to work.

I was made responsible for the remaining user endpoints:
getting one user by ID, getting a list of all users,
updating a user by ID, and deleting a user by ID. It
took we some time to get one user by ID, as I was trying
to use the same get user endpoint the authenticator used
which required a username as an input. I ended up making
a new endpoint that got users by ID. The other endpoints
were rather easy and came together in no time.

This week I worked on:

* Planning API endpoints with the team
* Building a create user endpoint
* Planning our SQL tables
* Building all our SQL tables
* Creating our wireframes

The team spent the past two weeks planning and
organizing our application. We built our wireframes
first alongside our MVP and stretch goals.

Following the initial outlining we created our API
templates and build the create user endpoint with
authentication and login/logout capabilities. We
created a create event endpoint, but it doesn't
connect to the database or create data.
