This week I worked on:

* Planning API endpoints with the team
* Building a create user endpoint
* Planning our SQL tables
* Building all our SQL tables
* Creating our wireframes

The team spent the past two weeks planning and
organizing our application. We built our wireframes
first alongside our MVP and stretch goals.

Following the initial outlining we created our API
templates and build the create user endpoint with
authentication and login/logout capabilities. We
created a create event endpoint, but it doesn't
connect to the database or create data.
