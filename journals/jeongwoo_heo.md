Week 1 (Nov 6 - 10)

During week 1, we worked together to design a wireframe of our web application using Excalidraw.
We also created a template of the required API endpoints that were derived from data on each page of 
our wireframe. Our biggest blocker was making sure that our API endpoints were being correctly 
designed so that the actual implementation would be simple.

Week 2 (Nov 13 - 17)

During week 2, we worked together to setup the SQL database and created our tables using 
migrations. We also created the User endpoint and implemented login and logout Authentication
for the user. Our biggest blocker was attempting to generate the correct response without any
errors for our user login authentication.

Week 3 (Nov 20 - 22)

During week 3, we assigned API endpoints for each of our team members and completed our endpoints
successfully. We were also able to get started on the frontend for our User login/logout. Our biggest
blocker was trying to fix the GET all timelogs endpoint to output correctly onto the FastAPI page.
