This week I worked on:
* Main page functionaily and css
* Adding weekly logs to metrics page and css
* Unit tests for get and create user timelogs

This week our team worked on fixing bugs for all
our pages. We also worked on styling together. We
were able to reach all our required checkpoints.

During this week I spent a lot of time learning how
to format dates in order for them to show up in a
reable manner for the user. I also spent a good
amount of time working on css for the main and
metrics page. Displaying graphs and and getting data
to show up on the graphs was difficult, but it ended
up working out.

This week I worked on:
* Creating a frontend page for user daily logs
* Updating authentication for user daily logs
* Fixing pipeline error for daily log

This week the team finished almost all of the
frontend functionality. We were able to reach all
checkpoints.

While working on the daily log page, I was getting
errors because of the order my use effects we being
called. It was difficult for me to pin point the
issue, but eventually I was able to fix these issues
thanks to the networking tab.

This week we worked on:
* Created endpoint for getting user timelog
* Created endpoint for updating user timelog

Our team spent these last three days working on
the remaining endpoints. We have run into a blocker
relating to the datetime field in get user timelogs.
The initial solution worked, but we want to to
improve upon it.

This week we worked on:
* Authentication and endpoints

We did mob programming and worked on authentication
and creating an endpoint an end point.

Today, I learned how to clear the database for
BeeKeeper. This is helpful to know when making
changes to code since new code may not work with
entries saved in the old database.
