This week we worked on:
* Created endpoint for getting user timelog
* Created endpoint for updating user timelog

Our team spent these last three days working on
the remaining endpoints. We have ran into a blocker
relating to the datetime field in get user timelogs.
The initial solution worked, but we want to to
improve upon it.

This week we worked on:
* Authentication and endpoints

We did mob programming and worked on authentication
and creating an endpoint an end point.

Today, I learned how to clear the database for
BeeKeeper. This is helpful to know when making
changes to code since new code may not work with
entries saved in the old database.
