## Nov 13-17

This week I worked collaboratively with my teammates to create our SQL database and tables, create User endpoints as well as authentication.

Conversations were good and productive especially around how we wanted to create our tables.

Figuring out why the Userform was giving an error while still creating a user was an ah-ha moment.

## Nov 20th-22

Got more work done on endpoints and spent most of my time helping teammates and trying to get frontend authentication.

Conversations were good and we did some work as a team.

No big ah-hah moments.
