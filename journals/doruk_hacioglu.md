## Nov 13-17

This week I worked collaboratively with my teammates to create our SQL database and tables, create User endpoints as well as authentication.

Conversations were good and productive especially around how we wanted to create our tables.

Figuring out why the Userform was giving an error while still creating a user was an ah-ha moment.

## Nov 20th-22

Got more work done on endpoints and spent most of my time helping teammates and trying to get frontend authentication.

Conversations were good and we did some work as a team.

No big ah-hah moments.

## Nov 27th to Dec 1st

Got work done on userpage and frontend auth, working on mainpage frontend

Convos were good and we worked as a team for some blocker solving

No big ah-hah moments.

No big ah-hah moments.
